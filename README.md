# Genos_database

DATA Genos is a website that contains information about genes and the mutations that cause diseases. It does this by summing the total mutations observed in protein domains collected from independently reported data on mutations observed in genes that share that particular protein domain. When a gene page is updated with new mutations in one of its protein domains, that count is added to the total count of mutations in that corresponding protein domain page. To better understand this, imagine a researcher who has observed a mutation in domain PF00454 of gene PRKDC and another researcher who has observed a mutation in domain PF02259 of PRKDC. Each researcher would update the number of observed mutations seen in their respective patient on the gene page. This would increment the total number of observed mutations for each of the PF00454 and PF02259 protein_domain pages. The protein domain pages will contain the total count observed across genes as well as additional information about the protein domain. The pages describing genes and proteins are created by moderators. Users can update gene pages with the mutations they have observed in the protein domains of that particular gene. These updates have to be approved by the moderator.
